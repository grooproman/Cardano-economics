# Cardano
The Cardano blockchain ecosystem is an effective technology platform for launching financial applications. The internal token of the Cardano system is ADA cryptocurrency working in the Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL). CSL is the first layer in a distributed registry; here, transactions between crypto-wallets are processed. The Cardano Computation Layer (CCL) layer has been created, to support decentralized applications.

Multilayer structure simplifies network protocol updates. Cardano developers use Haskell's secure programming language. As a consensus algorithm, the Cardano cryptocurrency network (ADA) uses the upgraded Proof-of-Stake Ouroboros, created by Professor Aggelos Kiais.

The developers call Cardano a third-generation Blockchain. The first generation includes the BTC cryptocurrency and its forks, and the second generation includes Ethereum. The task of the Cardano ecosystem is to preserve and develop the positive aspects of previous blockchain ecosystems, getting rid of their inherent disadvantages. First of all, the problems of scaling and energy consumption should be solved.

Mining on the POS algorithm is based on the use of a wallet with coins instead of computing equipment. Of course, you still can’t do without a computer, you need to install the program, download the blockchain chain, buy ADA coins on one of the exchanges, and then take part in the generation of blocks. Consensus is reached through a general vote by the Cardano digital asset holders who choose the slot leaders taking into account the share in the blockchain of everyone who has a Cardano wallet. These trusted nodes process transactions and sign blocks. By and large, cardano mining differs from Casper only in some technical details.

Cardano cryptocurrency is not so innovative. Competitors have similar achievements, and the philosophical ideas of theorists do not always meet the real requirements of users.
Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, said: "In essence, cryptocurrencies are trying to create a system in which we can make decisions without a leader." This is easier said than done, and creates a lot of problems. Nevertheless, he believes that Cardano is on the way to creating a fair system that combines the best parts of democracy and meritocracy and combines them into one. Charles said: “Not everyone has the right to have an opinion on everything. Therefore, perhaps we can create a system in which you can delegate your vote or your power to someone else. ”
Cardano is a focused technology designed to create a new decentralized economy and democratize finance in emerging markets. Cardano will allow you to create and execute decentralized applications and contracts in an inexpensive, secure and scalable way.

***Cardano network parts and their motives***

**Coin holders** are technology enthusiasts and devotees who believe in a technical solution. For them, ADA is an investment tool and an opportunity to support the development of the network by the founders and companies


**The Cardano Foundation** is the supervisory and educational authority. The main motives are the popularization of Cardano implementation, standardization, protocol protection, community support and development, and guarantee the accountability of stakeholders. 

**Input Output HK (IOHK)** develops and services the Cardano ecosystem. The main task is the development and implementation of innovative p2p technologies of financial services in emerging markets that do not have access to traditional financial instruments.

**Emurgo** is a commercial organization financing and supporting innovative applications running on the Cardano blockchain. Emurgo provides solutions for developers, governments, startups, companies, develops applications for the corporate sector, invests in startups, and promotes technology through education.

**Cardano Pools** is a platform with specialized software on which coin holders combine their cryptocurrency assets to increase the share of the node in the network. The main goal is to accumulate the assets of coin holders to get a higher reward from the network for block confirmation.

**Pool's holders** - receive a higher income in comparison with individual mining, due to a larger share of the pool in the network.

**Commercial and non-commercial organizations** - use the technology for practical purposes. The main goal is the search and use of convenient, fast, scalable blockchain technology for implementation in their processes.
Developers - developing and creating applications in the Haskell programming language
